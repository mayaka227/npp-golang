##Syntax Support for golang in Notepad++ 

This file provides Syntax highlighting support for Google Go Language (golang) in Notepad++

Installation for Notepad++ 6
----
1. Download the [zip](https://github.com/tlowry/npp-golang/archive/master.zip) or with "git clone https://github.com/tlowry/npp-golang.git". 
Saving the golang.xml page or copy-pasting will probably corrupt the xml file and cause an [import error](https://github.com/tlowry/npp-golang/issues/2).

2. On the Notepad++ toolbar menu select Language->Define your language

2. A user defined language window should open. Click the import button and navigate to the golang.xml file 
	and open it.
	
3. You may need to re-open your .go files or restart notepad++ in order to see the highlighting changes.
